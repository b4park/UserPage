In the great words of **Elon Musk**:
> Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.
I life my life with this quote as my backbone when facing any obstacle or setbacks
Learning different languages and how to use some of the basic git commads like:
```
git clone
git add
git commit
```
Makes me a better programmer everyday and no matter how challenging a topic is, I always find a way to solve it, whether it is by myself or with some help.
And of course, I cannot discredit one of the most useful websites to every programmer out there, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

## Short-term Goals
